    "# Docker's basics\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s a ton of Docker material out there — blogs, videos, GPTs, LLMs, etc. I’m going to share **my personal take** on Docker, why it exists, and the bare essentials you need to actually get started without drowning in jargon.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Birth of Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply: **Docker lets you run multiple “computers” inside your computer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual machines (VMs) do this too — but they are *heavy*, slow to start, and come with a lot of extra baggage (full OS per VM). Docker, on the other hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Lightweight** — Shares the host system’s kernel instead of carrying an entire OS.\n",
    "* **Isolated environments** — No dependency conflicts between projects.\n",
    "* **Portable** — Package your app, send it to someone, and it’ll run exactly the same on their machine.\n",
    "* **Easy setup** — No “works on my machine” drama.\n",
    "* **Cloud-ready** — Combine it with Docker Hub or GitHub to share pre-built environments instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Docker as:\n",

    "If you like, I can **merge this full command cheat sheet into your Docker blog post** so it becomes a one-stop beginner + reference guide. That way, you don’t have to maintain two separate docs.\n",

    "## Breaking It Down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FROM** — The base image (Python 3.9). Think: “Start with a ready kitchen.”\n",
    "* **WORKDIR** — Where commands will run inside the container.\n",
    "* **COPY** — Move files from your computer into the image.\n",
    "* **RUN** — Execute commands when building the image (install dependencies).\n",
    "* **CMD** — The default command to run when the container starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## CMD vs ENTRYPOINT — What’s the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ENTRYPOINT** → The fixed part of the command that will *always* run.\n",
    "* **CMD** → The part you can override when running the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of ENTRYPOINT as the *cake base* (always needed), and CMD as the *flavor* (you can swap chocolate for vanilla).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker isn’t magic — it’s just a smart way to package and run software so it’s consistent everywhere.\n",
    "Once you get the basic terms down and try a few builds yourself, you’ll wonder how you ever shipped apps without it. If you still dig deep You know docker compose which is much effient way to orchestrate multiple docker in a streamlined way."
